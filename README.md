# Hello

I believe the best way to acquire new knowledge is by putting it into practice.

I have been a GS1 standards enthusiast ever since I started working with pharmaceutical traceability in Brazil. Since then, many things have happened, others haven't, but we must never stop evolving when it comes to improving supply chain efficiency.

For this reason, some time ago I began my studies on **GS1 Digital Link** and, since the best way to learn is by doing, I decided to create this repository to apply the GS1 Digital Link standard in the creation of a Resolver.

**GS1 Digital Link** is an open standard that extends the capabilities of 2D codes by introducing the concept of Extended Packaging. To avoid placing unoptimized URLs on packaging, the Resolver acts as a URL redirector that even allows the addition of structured information so that systems can also utilize this additional data.
